Amusement Ride Injuries - WIP    

After finding myself in a wikipedia hole researching amusement ride injuries, I found a dataset on kaggle to do deep exploratory analysis dive. 

Data:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stevenlasch/roller-coaster-accidents

I'm most curious to learn:

What type of business has the most injuries? 
What types of rides are the most dangerous?
What kind of injuries are happening?
What ride manufacturers result in the most injuries?
Do injuries tend to be due to ride malfunction or where something else goes wrong?
